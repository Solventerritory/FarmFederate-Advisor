      "desc": "The Palmer Drought Severity Index dataset provides high spatial resolution (~4-km) thrice-monthly estimates of this widely used measure of integrated water supply and demand anomalies across the contiguous United States from 1979-present. The PDSI is calculated using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration derived from the gridded meteorological dataset of Abatzoglou (2013).  Potential evapotranspiration is computed using the Penman-Montieth equation for a reference grass surface. Available soil water holding capacity in the top 2.5m of the soil was derived from the STATSGO soils database and used in the computations. Whereas PDSI has typically been computed on monthly timescales, we compute these data three-times a month to provide more timely updates. Due to the spin-up of PDSI calculations, data for the first year of record should be used sparingly.  This dataset contains provisional products that are replaced with updated versions when the complete source data become available. Products can be distinguished by the value of the 'status' property. At first, assets are ingested with status='early'. After several days, they are replaced by assets with status='provisional'. After about 2 months, they are replaced by the final assets with status='permanent'."

Although researches have been done to detect whether a plant is healthy or diseased using Deep Learning and with the help of Neural Network, new techniques are still being discovered.  For Fewer Data Classical Machine Learning Models are said to outstand given the data is pre-processed well. On the same theory here is my approach for Detecting whether a plant leaf is healthy or unhealthy by utilizing the classical Machine Learning Models, Pre-processing the Image Data.  The data was fed to 7 Machine Learning Models with 10 fold cross-validation out of which Random Forest Classifier outperformed all the other models giving an accuracy of 97% on the test set."
