This script will be documented but the actual comprehensive notebook
needs to be too large for a single response. 

The complete notebook should include:
1. Fixed LoRA for all 17 models
2. Multiple real datasets (4+ text, 4+ images)
3. Federated training
4. Centralized training
5. Dataset comparison
6. Federated vs Centralized comparison
7. All previous features
