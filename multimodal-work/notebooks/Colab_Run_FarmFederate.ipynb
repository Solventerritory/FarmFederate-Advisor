        "- Primary goals (select all that apply): EDA / preprocessing / train smoke / full training on GPU / Qdrant demo / plotting / RAG demo.\n",
        "- Required libraries: confirm I should install from `requirements.txt` plus `qdrant-client`, `sentence-transformers`, and `faiss-cpu`.\n",
        "- Desired outputs: plots in `plots/`, results in `results/`, checkpoints in `checkpoints/` (optionally persisted to Google Drive path).\n",
        "- Target audience: beginner / intermediate / advanced (affects explanations and comments).\n",
        "- Include unit tests and a short VS Code integration guide? (yes/no)\n",
        "- Kernel / Python version to use on Colab (default: latest Colab Python; confirm if you need a specific version).\n",
